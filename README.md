## Overview

Enclosed is the code used for the second PopHIVE prototype dashboard, which transitions the code from an RShiny-based implementation to a JavaScript-based one for better performance. This repository includes the code for generating the JavaScript version of the dashboard, referencing data from the R-based version found in [PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE](https://github.com/PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE). During its development, the RShiny-based prototype was still being updated, so some of these updates are not reflected in this version.

The code was originally copied from a repository in the [YSPH Data Science and Data Equity](https://github.com/ysph-dsde) (YSPH-DSDE) GitHub Organization and was copied into the [PopHIVE](https://github.com/PopHIVE) GitHub Organization Aug 12th, 2025. At the time of transfer, the YSPH-DSDE GitHub Organization codebase was no longer being actively contributed to and had been archived.

The dashboard deployment can be found here: _____.

**Dates active:** Mar 10th â€“ May 9th, 2025

# PopHIVE Prototype Aims and Scope

## Aims

**Primary goal:** Reproduce [PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE](https://github.com/PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE) as it looks since March 10th, 2025 in JavaScript with one additional page as a simple landing page. The original outline was borrowed from a previous project, with the most original version reflected in [PopHIVE/PopHIVE](https://github.com/PopHIVE/PopHIVE). Professor Dan Weinberger shared some preferred color pallets for the plots: [saturated](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Paired&n=10) and [muted](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Set3&n=10).

**Secondary goal:** Suggest improvements on website structure, organization, and aesthetics. Give advice on best practices that are currently reflected in the DSDE-PopHIVE Quarto file and best practices that need to be implemented going forward. NOTE: we do not have a set branding (website color palette, font families, etc.) for PopHIVE. We are using the YSPH logo and favicon for the time being.

**Tertiary goal:** Add plot blocks into the dashboard webpage skeleton for recently harmonized and cleaned datasets from new domains of research.

## Scope

- Two webpages:

    1. Landing page with the title, authors, and link to the dashboard.
    2. Dashboard that is a reproduction of DSDE-PopHIVE as it is as of March 10th.
 
- Three prepared datasets:

    1. Respiratory_Infections.gz.parquet (source DSDE-PopHIVE/Data - [file URL](https://github.com/PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE/blob/main/Data/Respiratory_Infections.gz.parquet))
    2. Respiratory_Infections_Wastewater.gz.parquet (source DSDE-PopHIVE/Data - [file URL](https://github.com/PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE/blob/main/Data/Respiratory_Infections_Wastewater.gz.parquet))
    3. Opioid_Overdoses.csv (source DSDE-PopHIVE/Data - [file URL](https://github.com/PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE/blob/main/Data/Opioid_Overdoses.csv)) and [subsets converted to parquet](https://github.com/PopHIVE/DSDE-PopHIVE/tree/main/Data/Opioid%20Overdoses)

- Plot types:

    1. Within one data source (i.e. RSV-NET, NSSP, Epic Cosmos, etc.) that show rates and counts stratified by geolocation, age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
    2. Between data sources that show scaled counts. This version might have a lot of NA's.

  NOTE: Reference [PopHIVE/data-gov](https://github.com/PopHIVE/data-gov) file `Suggested Static Plots.R` for guidance on plotting from the three prepared datasets.
